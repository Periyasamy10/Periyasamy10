## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 [jenkins-kubernetes-agent-setup](https://github.com/Periyasamy10/jenkins-kubernetes-agent-setup)  
Installed Jenkins as a pod inside a Kubernetes cluster. On triggering a pipeline, it dynamically creates a slave pod to execute the pipeline tasks.

### 🔹 [terrafrom-aws-eks](https://github.com/Periyasamy10/terrafrom-aws-eks)  
Provisioned an AWS EKS cluster using Terraform, including VPC, subnets, route tables, internet gateway, and NAT gateway configuration.

### 🔹 [opentelemetry-demo](https://github.com/Periyasamy10/opentelemetry-demo)  
A demo e-commerce application where I containerized services and managed deployments for the `product-catalog`, `ad`, and `frontend` microservices using GitHub Actions and Argo CD.

### 🔹 [kubernetes_cluster_creation](https://github.com/Periyasamy10/kubernetes_cluster_creation)  
Created a two-node Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`, fully provisioned with Terraform and configured with Ansible.
